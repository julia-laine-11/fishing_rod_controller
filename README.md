# fishing_rod_controller
This was part of an EPICS team project for an automatically casting and reeling fishing rod. I designed this PCB for the controller so it would stop falling apart during travel and use.

Our project partner was a [kid named Colton in Indianapolis](https://www.facebook.com/ColtonsQuest/) who has AMC. He likes to fish but he cannot hold the fishing rod. Our team designed an automatically casting and reeling fishing rod to help him out.

I took lead of the electronics on the team and I created this PCB:

## Controller housing

*The lid is seperate and there are 3 buttons on the top. The controller housing is a triangle shape so Colton can easily hold it between his legs.*
